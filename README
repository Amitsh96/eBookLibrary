To run your eBook library project:

  # Navigate to the project directory
  cd ...\eBookLibrary"

  # Restore packages
  dotnet restore

  # Update database (creates the database if it doesn't exist)
  dotnet ef database update --project eBookLibrary

  # Run the application
  dotnet run --project eBookLibrary

  The application will start and be available at:
  - HTTPS: https://localhost:44365
  - HTTP: http://localhost:5103

  Open either URL in your browser. The HTTPS version is recommended for demonstrating security features.

  If you encounter any database issues, you can also run:
  # Build first to ensure everything compiles
  dotnet build

  # Then run with specific HTTPS profile
  dotnet run --project eBookLibrary --launch-profile https
